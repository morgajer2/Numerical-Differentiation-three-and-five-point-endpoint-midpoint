# Numerical-Differentiation-three-and-five-point-endpoint-midpoint
this repo is a project for Software Engineering degree. This numeric method is used to get close results for getting f'(x0).

## User's menual:

To use each method you need to define your function using Sympy and Symbol X.
After defining you will be able to use every method.


Each method gets 3 arguments: 
* f- the func defined as above
* x0 - the x-value you want to find the derived of. meaning  f'(x0).
* h - the chosen difference between two close dots. The smaller h is the better the result accourency.
